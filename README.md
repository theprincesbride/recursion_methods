# recursion_methods
Recursion assignments from The Odin Project

For the first assignment, I will put together an iterative fibonacci method that takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence.  Then, I will put together a recursive fibonacci method that will solve the same problem recursively.

For the second assignment, I will put together a merge_sort recursive method that takes an array and returns a sorted array.
